            You will be anonymously paired with another participant. Each of you will choose, one after the other,
            between two options.<br>
            We will first explain how your choices, and the other participant's choices, determine how much you will earn from the experiment.
            We will then explain who chooses first and who chooses second.
        </p>

        <p>Suppose the participant who chooses first chooses A:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the other participant then also chooses A, both receive {{C.PAYOFFC}}</li>
            <li>If the other participant then chooses B, he/she will receive {{C.PAYOFFD}} while the partici-pant who chose first will receive {{C.PAYOFFA}}</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Suppose the participant who chooses first chooses B:</p>
