<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
    In this task you have been randomly paired with another person, whom we will refer to as the other. This other
    person is someone you do not know and will remain mutually anonymous. All of your choices are completely
    confidential. You will be making a series of decisions about allocating resources between you and this other person.
    For each of the following questions, please indicate the distribution you prefer most by marking the respective
    position along the midline. You can only make one mark for each question.
</p>
<p>
    Your decisions will yield money for both
    yourself and the other person. In the example below,
    a person has chosen to distribute money so that he/she receives
    50 points, while the anonymous other person receives 40 points.
</p>
<p>
    There are no right or wrong answers, this is all
    about personal preferences. After you have made your decision,
    write the resulting distribution of money on the
    spaces on the right. As you can see, your choices will influence
    both the amount of money you receive as well as the
    amount of money the other receives.
