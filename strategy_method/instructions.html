<div>

    <p>
        You have been paired with another player.
        One player is the proposer and once is the responder.
    </p>

    <p>
        The two of you will together receive {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}.
        The proposer will make the responder an offer,
        which the responder can accept or reject.
        If the offer is rejected, both will
        receive nothing.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Proposer's role
    </h4>

    <p>
        The proposer has the following {{ C.OFFER_CHOICES_COUNT }}
        options on how to divide the {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} between the
        two players.
    </p>

    <ol>
        {{ for a in C.POSSIBLE_ALLOCATIONS }}
        <li>{{ a.p2_amount }} for the responder (the proposer keeps {{ a.p1_amount }})</li>
        {{ endfor }}
    </ol>

    <h4>
        Responder's role
    </h4>

    <p>
        While the proposer makes the offer, the responder can select
        which {{ C.OFFER_CHOICES_COUNT }} offers stated above
        to accept or reject.
        After the proposer has made the offer, it will be either
        accepted or rejected according to the responder's choices.
    </p>
