        <p>
            You will be anonymously paired with another participant. Each of you will choose, one after the other,
            between two options.<br>
            We will first explain how your choices, and the other participant's choices, determine your bonus which you
            will receive in addition to your base payment for completing the experiment.
            We will then explain who chooses first and who chooses second.
        </p>

        <p>Suppose the first chooser chooses A:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the second chooser then also chooses A, both receive ${{C.PAYOFFC}}</li>
            <li>If the second chooser chooses B, he/she will receive ${{C.PAYOFFD}} while the first chooser will receive
                ${{C.PAYOFFA}}</li>
