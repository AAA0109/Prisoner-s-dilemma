    <p>
        This game is a simulation of how subsequent generations use a natural resource
        (cutting down a forest for lumber).
    </p>

    <p>
        The forest will start out with 100 acres.
        Each generation, the size of the forest increases by a factor of {{ C.MULTIPLIER }}.
        But each generation also has the opportunity to extract some amount of the forest for lumber.

        During this generation the rainforest has grown
        from {{ player.value0 }}
        to <b>{{ player.value1 }}</b> acres.

    <p>
        How much of this do you want to extract for the current
        generation?
