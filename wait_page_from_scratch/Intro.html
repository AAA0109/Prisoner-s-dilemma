<p>
    Simple wait page implemented from scratch, using live pages.
    You can use this if you need functionality that differs from that offered
    by the built-in WaitPage, such as
    making the wait page show who is still waiting,
    using a live_method on the wait page,
    having a timeout on the wait page, etc.
</p>
<p>
    There are {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }} players per group.
