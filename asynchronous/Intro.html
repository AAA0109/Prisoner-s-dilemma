<p>
    This is an ultimatum game.
    You are Player 1. You have an endowment of {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}.
    You can offer any portion of this to Player 2.
    If Player 2 accepts your offer, you both get paid according to your split.
    If Player 2 rejects the offer, you both get paid nothing.

    <i>
        What's special about this game is that
        rather than playing with another player live, you will be paired with someone
        who already played earlier.
        If nobody already played earlier, you will start a new group.
